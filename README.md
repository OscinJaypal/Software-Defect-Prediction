# Software-Defect-Prediction
Software defect prediction using Python libraries involves leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast potential defects in software based on historical data. Python libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and pandas are commonly used in each phase of this process, offering robust tools for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment in software defect prediction projects. This approach helps software development teams proactively identify and mitigate potential defects, improving overall software quality and reliability.

Software Defect Prediction Using Python Libraries:

1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
  a.	Data Collection: Gather historical data related to software development, including metrics like code complexity, code churn (changes over time), developer experience, and previous defect occurrences.

b.	Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize numeric features, and encode categorical variables if necessary. This prepares the dataset for model training.
2.	Feature Selection and Engineering:
  a.	Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that have predictive power for defect occurrence. Techniques like correlation       analysis, feature importance from machine learning models, or domain knowledge can guide this process.
  
  b.	Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's ability to capture patterns related to software defects. This might include aggregating metrics over time or deriving new features from existing data.
3.	Model Selection and Training:
  a.	Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for defect prediction, such as logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), or gradient boosting machines (GBM). Python libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow provide           implementations of these algorithms.
  
  b.	Model Training: Split the data into training and validation sets. Train the selected models on the training data, tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.
4.	Evaluation and Validation:
  a.	Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics help gauge how well the model predicts software defects compared to actual observations.
  
  b.	Cross-Validation: Employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation to validate the model's robustness and generalizability across different subsets of the data.
5.	Deployment and Monitoring:
  a.	Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is trained and validated, deploy it in a production environment to predict defects in new software developments or updates.
  b.	Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain periodically using new data to maintain its effectiveness over time.
